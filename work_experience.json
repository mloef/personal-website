Reduced p99 latency from 2s to <100ms and downtime by orders of magnitude. Developed a custom Ethereum transaction parser to transform on-chain data into a human readable form, enabling another migration. Implemented run-time input and output validation for significant pieces of the Typescript backend, catching and fixing many errors and external data issues."}]
