Backend Engineer
November 2022 - April 2023  (6 months)
New York, New York, United States
Made core contributions in reliability that were critical to the zero downtime
launch of the company's first mobile app.
Spearheaded a large-scale service migration by moving the app’s launch page
backend endpoint off an unreliable data provider. Reduced p99 latency from
2s to &lt;100ms and downtime by orders of magnitude.
Developed a custom Ethereum transaction parser to transform on-chain data
into a human readable form, enabling another migration.
Implemented run-time input and output validation for significant pieces of the
Typescript backend, catching and fixing many errors and external data issues.
