Uniswap Labs
Backend Engineer
November 2022 - April 2023  (6 months)
New York, New York, United States
Made core contributions in reliability that were critical to the zero downtime
launch of the company's first mobile app.
Spearheaded a large-scale service migration by moving the app’s launch page
backend endpoint off an unreliable data provider. Reduced p99 latency from
2s to &lt;100ms and downtime by orders of magnitude.
Developed a custom Ethereum transaction parser to transform on-chain data
into a human readable form, enabling another migration.
Implemented run-time input and output validation for significant pieces of the
Typescript backend, catching and fixing many errors and external data issues.

December 2020 - September 2022  (1 year 10 months)
Santa Monica, California, United States
Independently uncovered inefficiency in loading job for online feature store,
saving $985k/year
Third engineer on project to simplify bringing new features from
experimentation to production. Reduced onboarding process from weeks to a
few days and onboarded fifteen teams.
Second engineer on new ads ranking feature pipeline: https://eng.snap.com/
